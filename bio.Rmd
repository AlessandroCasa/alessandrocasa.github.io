I am an Assistant Professor in Statistics (RTDa) at the Faculty of Economics and Management at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano. <br>
Previously, I worked as Postdoctoral Researcher at the University College Dublin, under the supervision of Prof. Brendan Murphy and I have been affiliated both with the Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics and with Vistamilk SFI Research Centre.
&nbsp; 

I am a member of the organizing committee of spectroscopy monthly seminars in Vistamilk and of the annual *International Workshop on Spectroscopy and Chemometrics*.

### Research 
My research focuses on the development of flexible statistical methodologies to model high-dimensional and complex structured data, arising from different applied frameworks. More specifically, I am particularly interested on latent variable models, on the density-based formulation of the clustering problem and on the challenges arising when dealing with spectroscopic data. Recently, I started working on inferential problems arising in high-dimensional settings as for example when dealing with spatio-temporal data. <br>
My main research interests are: 

* Mixture models and model-based clustering <br>
* Modal clustering <br>
* Graphical models <br>
* Variable selection and dimensionality reduction <br>
* Latent variable models <br>
* Computational statistics <br> 
* Chemometrics <br>
