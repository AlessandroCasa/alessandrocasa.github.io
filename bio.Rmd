I am a Senior Assistant Professor in Statistics (RTD-b) at the Department of Economics at the University of Bergamo. <br>
Previously, I worked as Junior Assistant Professor at the Free University of Bozen-Bolzano and as Postdoctoral Researcher at the University College Dublin (supervisor: Prof. Brendan Murphy, affiliation: Insight SFI Research Centre for Data Analytics, Vistamilk SFI Research Centre).

### Research 
My research focuses on the development of flexible statistical methodologies to model high-dimensional and complex structured data, arising from different applied frameworks. More specifically, I am particularly interested on latent variable models, on the density-based formulation of the clustering problem and on the challenges arising when dealing with spectroscopic data. Recently, I started working on inferential problems arising in high-dimensional settings as for example when dealing with spatio-temporal data. <br>
My main research interests are: 

* Mixture models and model-based clustering <br>
* Modal clustering <br>
* Graphical models <br>
* Variable selection and dimensionality reduction <br>
* Latent variable models <br>
* Computational statistics <br> 
* Chemometrics
